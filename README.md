### **Brain Tumor Classification using Deep Learning**  

This project focuses on **brain tumor classification** using deep learning techniques. It utilizes a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify brain MRI images into four categories:  
✅ **Glioma Tumor**  
✅ **Meningioma Tumor**  
✅ **No Tumor**  
✅ **Pituitary Tumor**  

### **Project Features**  
🔹 **Model Training**: A deep learning model is trained on MRI images using TensorFlow/Keras.  
🔹 **Dataset**: The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and preprocessed for training and testing.  
🔹 **Model Evaluation**: The training performance is visualized with accuracy and loss graphs.  
🔹 **Deployment**: A **Flask-based web application** allows users to upload MRI images and get predictions on tumor classification.  

### **Technologies Used**  
🖥️ Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, Flask, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  

### **How to Use?**  
1️⃣ Train the CNN model using `train.py` or Google Colab.  
2️⃣ Save the trained model as `.h5` or `.keras` format.  
3️⃣ Deploy the model using `Flask` and interact with the web interface to classify MRI images.  

🚀 **This project provides an efficient approach to assist in the early detection of brain tumors.**
